# OpenGameData Software Reference Platform

Below is a list of standard software libraries that make up the **OpenGameData Reference Platform**. This **reference platform** is meant as a *convention* for keeping new development coordinated with respect to the development and deployment environments.

## Justification

The bar for updating a package is relatively low, we only require some simple justification,
e.g. "we need a feature from a newer version to make X better,"
or "the current version is old and nobody uses it anymore,"
or "another library needs a newer version."

In general, we avoid allowing projects to become so oddly-specific as to be tied to a specific package/version. The onus is on us to keep OGD projects running on relatively recent library versions, to keep a low barrier for entry to new collaborators who want to start fresh.

However, any OpenGameData project should avoid using a different version of any of these libraries than what is listed. Instead, ask for a version bump and wait for an update to the platform, so we donâ€™t have incompatibilities pop up at random.

We use this list for GitHub Actions, requirements.txt, and .devcontainer files.
Note: for some libraries, we use .* to indicate any patch version may be used (we only specify patch version for mission-critical dependencies, such as database libraries).
